        <p><br />In 2020, like many others, the global lockdowns were a challenge for me that resulted in mental health
            issues. Navigating the isolation, uncertainty, and disruption of daily life was incredibly difficult. Amid
            this turmoil, I discovered strategies that not only helped me regain my balance but also led me to a new
            personal journey.</p>
        <p><br />One of the things I did was periodical <strong>digital detox</strong>. The constant barrage of news and
            social media exacerbated my anxiety, so I decided to unplug. This allowed me to reclaim my focus and
            emotional equilibrium, gave me the space needed for deeper self-reflection on what was happening. <a
                href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/strain-media-overload/" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown
            that reducing screen time can significantly lower stress levels and improve overall well-being. I doubled
            down on healthy habits like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking</strong>: I tried to walk at least 30 minutes every day.</li>
            <li><strong>Breathing Exercises</strong>: Breathing exercises helped manage stress and increase mindfulness.
                Techniques like deep diaphragmatic breathing are well-documented for their benefits in reducing anxiety
                and improving focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Meditation</strong>: Mindfulness meditation became a daily practice, offering clarity and
                emotional stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Journaling</strong>: I began journaling regularly to process my thoughts and emotions. This
                practice provided me with a sense of control and a way to track my progress and also helped me 'define'
                my feelings.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Exercise</strong>: Regular exercise became a cornerstone of my routine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br />Through this period of personal growth, I became intrigued with our brain and how it sometimes focuses
            on the negative things. My reading led me to the concept of <strong>neurointegration</strong> and the <a
                href="https://neurointegration.org/" target="_blank">Neurointegration Institute</a> - a framework
            designed to optimize brain function for a more productive and joyful life. Neurointegration involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NeuroSprint</strong>: Controlling and planning our actions. Transforming the way you pursue your
                goals, boosting motivation, and focus.</li>
            <li><strong>NeuroSurfing</strong>: Changing our thinking patterns to defeat self-sabotage, procrastination,
                and perfectionism.</li>
            <li><strong>NeuroBalance</strong>: Emotional regulation techniques. Regulate your mental state so you can
                reduce stress, improve performance, overcome and prevent burnout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br />As I delved into this field, I took a course in neurointegration, which deepened my understanding of
            how brain function impacts overall well-being. This knowledge empowered me to make more informed decisions
            about my mental health and productivity. I also adopted various time management methods to boost my
            productivity, like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pomodoro</strong>: This method, involving focused work intervals followed by breaks, has
                significantly improved my efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Daily Priorities</strong>: Identifying and tackling three main tasks each day has helped me stay
                organized and goal-oriented.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br />Additionally, setting <strong>annual goals</strong> and reflecting on them regularly has been
            instrumental in achieving my long-term objectives. I use the <a href="https://yearcompass.com"
                target="_blank">YearCompass</a>, which helps in planning and reflecting on the past year to set
            actionable goals for the future.</p>
        <p><br />My journey through mental health challenges and into a place of balance has been transformative. By
            integrating these practices and methodologies, I've not only managed to overcome my struggles but also built
            a foundation for continuous personal and professional growth.</p>
        <p><br />All the struggles helped me understand that the pursuit of happiness is intentional. It requires
            intentional actions, self-reflection, and a commitment to well-being.</p>
