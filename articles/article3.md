# Neurointegration, burnout, digital detox, YearCompass & hapiness <br /> <br />

In 2020, like many others, the global lockdowns were a challengue for me that resulted in mental health issues. Navigating the isolation, uncertainty, and disruption of daily life was incredibly difficult. Amid this turmoil, I discovered strategies that not only helped me regain my balance but also led me to new personal journey. <br /> <br />

One of the things I did was periodical **digital detox**. The constant barrage of news and social media exacerbated my anxiety, so I decided to unplug. This allowed me to reclaim my focus and emotional equilibrium, gave me the space needed for deeper self-reflection on what was happening. [Studies](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/strain-media-overload/) have shown that reducing screen time can significantly lower stress levels and improve overall well-being. I doubled down on healthy habits like: <br /> <br />

- **Walking**: I tried to walk at least 30 minutes every day. <br />

- **Breathing Exercises**: Breathing exercises helped manage stress and increase mindfulness. Techniques like deep diaphragmatic breathing are well-documented for their benefits in reducing anxiety and improving focus. <br />

- **Meditation**: Mindfulness meditation became a daily practice, offering clarity and emotional stability. <br />

- **Journaling**: I began journaling regularly to process my thoughts and emotions. This practice provided me with a sense of control and a way to track my progress and also helped me 'define' my feelings. <br />

- **Physical Exercise**: Regular exercise became a cornerstone of my routine. <br /> <br />

Through this period of personal growth, I became intrigued with our brain and how it sometimes focuses on the negative things. My reading led my to the concept of **neurointegration** and the [Neurointegration Institute](https://neurointegration.org/) - a framework designed to optimize brain function for a more productive and joyful life. Neurointegration involves: <br /> <br />

- **NeuroSprint**: Controling and planning our actions. Transforming the way you pursue your goals, boost motivation and focus
- **NeuroSurfing**: Changing our thinking patterns to defeat self-sabotage, procrastination and perfectionism.
- **NeuroBalance**: Emotional regulation techniques. Regulate your mental state so you can reduce stress, improve performance, overcome and prevent burnout. <br /><br />

As I delved into this field, I took a course in neurointegration, which deepened my understanding of how brain function impacts overall well-being. This knowledge empowered me to make more informed decisions about my mental health and productivity. I also adopted various time management methods to boost my productivity, like: <br />

- **Pomodoro**: This method, involving focused work intervals followed by breaks, has significantly improved my efficiency.
- **Daily Priorities**: Identifying and tackling three main tasks each day has helped me stay organized and goal-oriented. <br /><br />

Additionally, setting **annual goals** and reflecting on them regularly has been instrumental in achieving my long-term objectives. I use the **[YearCompass](https://yearcompass.com)**, which helps in planning and reflecting on the past year to set actionable goals for the future. <br /><br />
My journey through mental health challenges and into a place of balance has been transformative. By integrating these practices and methodologies, I've not only managed to overcome my struggles but also built a foundation for continuous personal and professional growth. <br /><br />
All the struggles helped me understand the pursuit of happiness is intentional. It requires intentional actions, self-reflection, and a commitment to well-being.
