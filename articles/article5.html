    <p>I've had the opportunity to work at different companies, each with different approaches to design, tools, and
      culture around managing and maintaining layouts. I often had to work with other people's design, aka 'creative
      chaos'. Diving into a task and searching for the needed layout took up a lot of valuable time and energy that
      could have been spent more efficiently.</p>

    <p>When looking at the problem from the outside, it doesn't seem all that serious. But if you delve deeper into
      the situation and look more closely, additional issues emerge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low productivity:</strong> Extra time is spent studying and immersing into the design. In the
        future, it will be challenging to find relevant designs.</li>
      <li><strong>Work quality:</strong> The inability to focus on details due to chaos can affect the design quality.
        Errors or omissions may occur due to a lack of attention to detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Stress and fatigue:</strong> Constantly battling chaos can be a source of stress and fatigue, which
        in turn can negatively impact the creative process.</li>
      <li><strong>Development and testing delays:</strong> Due to 'creative chaos', onboarding developers and testers
        will be really difficult.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Best practices for designers to easily onboard developers</strong></h2>

    <p><strong>Consistent Naming Conventions:</strong> Use a consistent and logical naming system throughout your
      project. Example: <code>btn/primary/large</code>, <code>icon/navigation/home</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Hierarchical Naming:</strong> Reflect the structure and relationships between elements in your
      naming. Example: <code>header/nav</code>, <code>header/nav/item</code>, <code>footer/social</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Descriptive Names:</strong> Use names that describe the element’s purpose and function. Example:
      <code>btn-submit</code>, <code>icon-arrow-left</code>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Use Prefixes:</strong> Use prefixes to categorize elements by type. Example: <code>btn-</code>,
      <code>icon-</code>, <code>card-</code>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Avoid Special Characters:</strong> Stick to alphanumeric characters and hyphens/underscores. Avoid
      spaces and special characters. Example: <code>user-profile</code>, not <code>user@profile</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Use Frames and Sections:</strong> Organize your designs into frames and sections to keep related
      elements together. Example: Create frames for each screen or component state.</p>

    <p><strong>Component and Instance Usage:</strong> Utilize components and instances to maintain consistency and
      ease updates. Example: Create a button component and use instances throughout your design.</p>

    <p><strong>Style Guide and Design System:</strong> Develop and adhere to a style guide or design system for
      colors, typography, and spacing. Example: Use defined text styles like <code>Heading 1</code>,
      <code>Body</code>, and color styles like <code>Primary</code>, <code>Secondary</code>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Layer Grouping:</strong> Group related layers to keep the layer panel organized. Example: Group
      layers for a card component: <code>card-header</code>, <code>card-content</code>, <code>card-footer</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Clear Layer Hierarchy:</strong> Structure layers logically, reflecting the visual hierarchy and
      grouping. Example: <code>Navbar</code>, <code>Navbar/Logo</code>, <code>Navbar/Menu</code>,
      <code>Navbar/Menu/Item</code>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Page Organization:</strong> Separate different design stages or types of content into different
      pages. Example: <code>Wireframes</code>, <code>Designs</code>, <code>Prototypes</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Use of Auto Layout:</strong> Use Auto Layout to create flexible and responsive designs. Example:
      Create a button with Auto Layout to adjust padding automatically.</p>

    <p><strong>Annotations and Notes:</strong> Use comments and notes to provide context and explanations for
      complex designs. Example: Add a note explaining the interaction flow on a prototype.</p>

    <p><strong>Version Control:</strong> Regularly save versions and document changes to track design evolution.
      Example: Use Figma’s version history to keep track of major changes.</p>

    <p><strong>Clean Up Regularly:</strong> Periodically review and clean up unused components, layers, and styles.
      Example: Remove old versions of components that are no longer in use.</p>
