# Why discipline is important for designers? <br /> <br />

I've had the opportunity to work at different companies, each with different approaches to design, tools, and culture around managing and maintaining layouts. I often had to work with other people's design, aka 'creative chaos'. Diving into a task and searching for the needed layout took up a lot of valuable time and energy that could have been spent more efficiently. <br /> <br />

When looking at the problem from the outside, it doesn't seem all that serious. But if you delve deeper into the situation and look more closely, additional issues emerge:

- **Low productivity:** Extra time is spent studying and immersing into the design.
- **Work quality:** The inability to focus on details due to chaos can affect the design quality. Errors or omissions may occur due to a lack of attention to detail.
- **Stress and fatigue:** Constantly battling chaos can be a source of stress and fatigue, which in turn can negatively impact the creative process.
- **Design artifacts:** In the future, it will be challenging to find relevant designs.
- **Development and testing delays:** Developers and testers will frequently need to ask the designer for help in finding the relevant screens. <br /> <br />

In such creative chaos, onboarding developers and testers will be really difficult. <br /> <br /><br /> <br />

### **Best Practices for designers:** <br /> <br />

**Consistent Naming Conventions:**

- Use a consistent and logical naming system throughout your project.
- Example: `btn/primary/large`, `icon/navigation/home`. <br /> <br />

**Hierarchical Naming:**

- Reflect the structure and relationships between elements in your naming.
- Example: `header/nav`, `header/nav/item`, `footer/social`. <br /> <br />

**Descriptive Names:**

- Use names that describe the element’s purpose and function.
- Example: `btn-submit`, `icon-arrow-left`. <br /> <br />

**Use Prefixes:**

- Use prefixes to categorize elements by type.
- Example: `btn-`, `icon-`, `card-`. <br /> <br />

**Avoid Special Characters:**

- Stick to alphanumeric characters and hyphens/underscores. Avoid spaces and special characters.
- Example: `user-profile`, not `user@profile`. <br /> <br />

**Use Frames and Sections:**

- Organize your designs into frames and sections to keep related elements together.
- Example: Create frames for each screen or component state. <br /> <br />

**Component and Instance Usage:**

- Utilize components and instances to maintain consistency and ease updates.
- Example: Create a button component and use instances throughout your design. <br /> <br />

**Style Guide and Design System:**

- Develop and adhere to a style guide or design system for colors, typography, and spacing.
- Example: Use defined text styles like `Heading 1`, `Body`, and color styles like `Primary`, `Secondary`. <br /> <br />

**Layer Grouping:**

- Group related layers to keep the layer panel organized.
- Example: Group layers for a card component: `card-header`, `card-content`, `card-footer`. <br /> <br />

**Clear Layer Hierarchy:**

- Structure layers logically, reflecting the visual hierarchy and grouping.
- Example: `Navbar`, `Navbar/Logo`, `Navbar/Menu`, `Navbar/Menu/Item`. <br /> <br />

**Page Organization:**

- Separate different design stages or types of content into different pages.
- Example: `Wireframes`, `Designs`, `Prototypes`. <br /> <br />

**Use of Auto Layout:**

- Use Auto Layout to create flexible and responsive designs.
- Example: Create a button with Auto Layout to adjust padding automatically. <br /> <br />

**Annotations and Notes:**

- Use comments and notes to provide context and explanations for complex designs.
- Example: Add a note explaining the interaction flow on a prototype. <br /> <br />

**Version Control:**

- Regularly save versions and document changes to track design evolution.
- Example: Use Figma’s version history to keep track of major changes. <br /> <br />

**Clean Up Regularly:**

- Periodically review and clean up unused components, layers, and styles.
- Example: Remove old versions of components that are no longer in use. <br /> <br />
